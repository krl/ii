1.4 (2008-08-09):
    - fix directory traversal on servers that support SAJOIN
      NOTE: not marking as security relevant as it is only possible to
      create directories outside (which is of course annoying) of the irc
      hierarchy but not overwriting arbitrary files with the channel name.
    - documentation fixes
    - general cleanup

1.3 (2007-07-14):
    - server messages about users (QUIT,JOIN) will no longer
      go to the user directories but to the server out file to
      give an easy method to monitor it and to prevent spamming
      the irc directory.

1.2 (2007-06-23):
    - Exit on channel creation failure, thanks Michael Prokop
    - Implemented joining of password protected channels
    - Removed -v option from the manpage since it's not implemented
